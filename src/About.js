            <p>
                <div>I graduated from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in 2024 where I got my B.A. in Computer Science and Minor in Critical Intelligence Studies. I currently work for Bank of America in their Technology Analyst Program. I'm very passionate about making a sustainable, positive impact with technology! In my freetime, I like to travel (this year I've gone to four different countries) and recently started running (the goal is to eventually run a marathon... definitely not there yet)!</div>
